# MaterialTumblrTheme

This repository consists of a Theme for [tumblr](www.tumblr.com), which is based on material design and uses the [MaterializeCSS](http://materializecss.com/)-Framework. Also this theme adds a feature, with which you may show your favourite quotes. The quotes change every week and may be changed when looked at (by the person visiting your blog). 

Here you can see a screenshot of the [Testblog](hellowprl.tumblr.com) for this theme.

The quotes can be changed by using the TumblrMaterialThemeQuotesGenerator (Android- and Windows-version available), whose code you can also see in this repo. The built PC-version can be downloaded [here (TumblrMaterialThemeQuotesGenerator.zip [39MB])](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-10UjgOC3DBUmxFNVNkOFlWVHM/view?usp=sharing) and the Android-version may be downloaded from this repo ([or click this link](https://github.com/JP1998/MaterialTumblrTheme/blob/master/QuotesGenerator%20-%20Android/Tumblr%20Material%20Theme.apk?raw=true)). The quotes can be easily saved on your computer and android-phone in an .xml-File (and can therefore also be used on the correspondingly other device). The generated code should be copy-pasted into the "Quotes JavaScript Code"-textfield of the Tumblr-theme if you want to use this feature.

Here you can see screenshots of the most important parts of the Windows-version of the application (the android-version is quite the same from functionality):
