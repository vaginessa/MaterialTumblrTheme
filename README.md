# MaterialTumblrTheme

This repository consists of a Theme for [tumblr](www.tumblr.com), which is based on material design and uses the [MaterializeCSS](http://materializecss.com/)-Framework. Also this theme adds a feature, with which you may show your favourite quotes. The quotes change every week and may be changed when looked at (by the person visiting your blog). 

Here you can see a screenshot of the [Testblog](hellowprl.tumblr.com) for this theme.

The quotes can be changed by using the TumblrMaterialThemeQuotesGenerator, whose code you can also see in this repo. The built program can be downloaded [here (TumblrMaterialThemeQuotesGenerator.zip [39MB])](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-10UjgOC3DBUmxFNVNkOFlWVHM/view?usp=sharing). The quotes can be easily added, saved on your computer in an .xml-File and the generated code should be copy-pasted into the "Quotes JavaScript Code"-textfield.

Here you can see screenshots of the most important parts of the application:
